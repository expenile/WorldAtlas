## API Used

I have utilized the **REST Countries API** to fetch detailed information about countries. This API provides comprehensive data, including country names, flags, population, region, and capital.

### How I Used the API

1. **Fetching Data**: I use the `getCountryData` function to fetch data from the API.
    ```javascript
    import axios from "axios";
    const api = axios.create({
      baseURL: "https://restcountries.com/v3.1",
    });
    export const getCountryData = () => {
      return api.get("/all?fields=name,population,region,capital,flags");
    };
    ```

2. **Fetching Individual Country Data**: I use the `getCountryIndData` function to fetch detailed data for a specific country.
    ```javascript
    export const getCountryIndData = (name) => {
      return api.get(
        `/name/${name}?fullText=true&fields=name,population,region,subregion,capital,tld,currencies,languages,borders,flags`
      );
    };
    ```
